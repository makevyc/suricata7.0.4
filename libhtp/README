============================================================================

LibHTP is a security-aware parser for the HTTP protocol and the related bits
and pieces. The goal of the project is mainly to support the Suricata use case.
Other use cases might not fully be supported, and we encourage you to cover these.

   |   STATUS
   |
   |   We are currently in the process of migrating LibHTP to a Rust version and thus
   |   support will be discontinued.

See the LICENSE, COPYING, and NOTICE files distributed with this work for

INSTALLATION
------------

Assuming you're using an already packaged version of LibHTP, the installation
process should be as simple as:

  $ sudo chmod u+x autogen.sh
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

If you've retrieved your LibHTP directly from the repository, you will need
to perform the following steps first:

 1. Update the version number in VERSION.

 2. Run autogen.sh, which will update the build system.



DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The best documentation at this time is the code itself and the Doxygen output (which
should be all right). There's also a quick start guide in the doc/ folder, which
should give you enough information to get going.


LICENSE
-------

LibHTP is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license (also known as "BSD New" and
"BSD Simplified".) The complete text of the license is enclosed in the file LICENSE.
